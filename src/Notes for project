The game is played with two dice. Each die is six sided
with the sides labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
Play consists of one or more throws of the dice.
On a throw each die is tossed once and the result of
the throw is the sum of the two numbers which show on the dice.
Specifically one play of the game is goes as follows:

The total for the first throw determines one of
three ways for the game to continue.
if 7 or 11, the player immediately wins.
if a 2, 3 or 12, the player immediately loses.
if some other total, that number is called the
players point and more throws of the dice are
required to determine if he/she wins or loses.
The player throws the dice repeatedly until the
result is either a 7 or the result is the point
again. If a 7 occurs before the point does, the
player loses. If the point occurs before a 7 the
player wins.
